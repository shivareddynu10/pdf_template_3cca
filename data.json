With a longer time horizon, one can generally afford to invest in instruments which have a higher risk rating, as there  will be a long timeline to ride out volatility. Age of the client and the stage of financial life cycle should be taken into consideration while determining the investment horizon e.g., an investor in growth stage of financial cycle who is still 20 to 30 years out from retirement  can have a longer investment horizon and therefore afford to invest more aggressively. A long-time horizon does not prevent having   tactical positions being held for shorter time and does not mean that each of your investments need to be held for a period matching your horizon. A short time horizon does not prevent you from holding products with longer tenor that have sufficient liquidity which would allow you to exit the positions before maturity with ease. Do note that there may be periods within your time horizon during which your portfolio may underperform or outperform compared to your objectives."

The degree of the increase in risk level will depend on the amount of borrowing in comparison to the assets in your portfolio. As a result of this magnification effect, using leverage for investment purposes carries a greater risk of loss than purchasing investments with cash and may also lead to losses that substantially exceed the original capital invested. Therefore, using leverage is not suitable for customers who cannot bear higher risk. Other factors such as liquidity and volatility of your investments should also be considered, as leveraging investments that are illiquid and volatile could lead to significantly higher losses.",

We would like to draw your attention to the risks of leverage as  described in the general risk disclosure statement provided to you. Please also note that the granting of any leverage is  subject to the discretion of the custodian bank and hence may be reduced or withdrawn at any point in time at the sole  discretion of the Custodian Bank.",

In such a scenario, the leverage provider will ask the investor to bring in additional funds or collateral as per leverage terms. If the investor does not get additional funds or collateral as per margin call notice, the leverage provider reserves the right to liquidate the underlying collateral and recover the loan which may result in full or partial loss of investment for the investor."
